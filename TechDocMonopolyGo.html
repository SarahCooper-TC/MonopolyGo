        <p>In Monopoly Go, dice rolling is the key to progressing. The game gives you several opportunities to win more dice: </p>
        <li>Daily Gifts</li>
        <li>Challenges</li>
        <li>Milestones</li>
        <p>The game provides multiple, timed offers where you can buy dice. The offers are typically pre-packaged with a specific amount of dice, and may or may not come with a sticker pack. </p> 
        </section>
        
        <section class="main-section" id="Railroads">
        <header>Railroads</header>
        <p>Landing on one of the four railroads will allow you to: </p>
        <li>Attempt to shut down another player's landmarks (buildings)</li>
        <li>Attempt a bank heist where you steal some or all of their money. </li>
        <li>Complete challenges</li>
        <p>To successfully complete a bank heist, you must match three icons. Once you match three, the bank heist is over.</p>
        </section>
    
        <section class="main-section" id="Building">
        <header>Building</header>
        <p>To level up your net worth in the game you must build landmarks. </p>
        <li>Each board has five landmarks.</li>
        <li>Each landmark has six builds to complete.</li>
        <li>Landmark build costs rise each time</li>
        <p>Completing your landmarks will allow you to complete a board, which will raise your net worth, and in turn give you upgrades and raise the amount of dice that are loaded each hour. </p>
        </section>
    
        <section class="main-section" id="Shields">
        <header>Shields</header>
        <p>Shields protect your builds in case other players try to shut you down and prevent you from progressing further in the game. </p>
        <li>The max amount of shields allowed in the game is five. </li>
        <li>You can win new shields and equip them by completing challenges and milestones.</li>
        <li>To replenish your shields you must roll and land on a tile with a shield on it.</li>
        <p>Each time a player attempts to shutdown a landmark on your board, one of your shields will disappear. Once all of your shields disappear your buildings will be able to be shutdown, which means you will need to pay to rebuild/fix them</p>
        </section>
    
        <section class="main-section" id="Stickers">
        <header>Stickers</header>
        <p>The game gifts you prizes which sometimes include a sticker pack. Each pack may contain anywhere from one to 6 stickers. </p>
        <li>There is a different color for different levels of stickers.</li>
        <li>Each sticker has a specific number of stars on them, which represents its level.</li>
        <li>You exchange or gift stickers to friends.</li>
        <p>A sticker pack with a number six means that it includes atleast one sticker with six stars.</p>
        </section>
    
        <section class="main-section" id="Tournaments">
        <header>Tournaments</header>
        <p>The Tournaments in Monopoly Go are a great way to level up and progress through the game faster. Each tournament is about twenty-four hours long and at the end you recieve awards if you place high enough. These include: </p>
        <li>Sticker Packs</li>
        <li>Dice</li>
        <li>Money</li>
        <p>By using the monopoly multiplier during tournaments, you can maximize your rewards and get ahead in tournaments to win the best of prizes.</p>
